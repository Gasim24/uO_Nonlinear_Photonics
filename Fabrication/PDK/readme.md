This Process Design Kit (PDK) allows for users to construct InGaAsP mask layouts by exporting GDSII files. GDSII files are an essential part of the semiconductor fabrication process as it is the file format used during lithography. There are two main lithography techniques, photolithography and electron-beam lithography. Photolithography is used in an industrial setting for Multi-Project Wafer (PMW) runs whereas electron-beam (more commonly known as E-beam) lithography is used in small batches for research and academics.

The layout of this PDK is intended to appease the largest number of usersby providing Basic Building Blocks (BBBs), Composite Building Blocks (CBBs) and Basic Technolohy Blocks (BTBs). 

### Basic Building Blocks (BBBs)
BBBs provide the user fundamental control of devices by using the most elementary building blocks.

### Composite Building Blocks (CBBs)
CBBs provide the user with a collecton of BBBs specified for a function. 

### Basic Technology Blocks (BTBs)
BTBs are physical structures that can have different functions. i.e. if an semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) is reversed biased it can also be used as a detector.
