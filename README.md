# uO Nonlinear Photonics
We are a research group that conducts design, fabrication and characterization in nonlinear photonics. Our goal is to develop integrated nonlinear photonic devices for applications in optical communications, sensing, and quantum information processing. We are located at the University of Ottawa, Canada.

## Research Areas

### III-V Integrated Photonics
We design, fabricate, and characterize integrated photonic devices based on III-V semiconductors and III-nitrides for nonlinear and quantum applications.

### Terahertz Photonics
We study the nonlinear optical properties of various materials at THz frequencies.

### Metamaterials
We explore nanostructuring and local-field effects as mechanisms to control and enhance the optical properties of materials.

## Semiconductor Statistics

### III-Vs
Our publication "Group III-V semiconductors as promising nonlinear integrated photonic platforms," contains info on III-V semiconductors optical properties, especially the nonlinear properties.
